      introduction: "A leading industrial automation company in Southeast Asia, specializing in heavy machinery and assembly line optimization, approached Cube AI Solutions to explore intelligent automation. They had already adopted traditional AI for predictive maintenance and anomaly detection, but operational bottlenecks, decision lags, and data silos were still hurting production uptime and quality consistency. Their primary concern: while AI helped analyze data, it lacked real-time decision-making autonomy. This gap between insight and action created a need for Agentic AI systems—capable of acting on behalf of human operators across environments.",

Operators had to manually validate insights from dashboards and implement interventions across shifts, increasing human error and operational fatigue. Moreover, the legacy control system could not scale with new IoT integrations or varied product configurations on the assembly line. It became evident that traditional AI pipelines lacked autonomy and contextual reasoning, leading to fragmented intelligence."
